# RaceCarFacts

Allows you to view either track or rally cars. Each car page will show an image of the car, its make/model/year, some mechanical specs, and a description about the car. You can change the car page via a 'Next Car' button, and you can save the specs and description of a car to a text file that the program will create if you click 'Save Facts and Description'.
